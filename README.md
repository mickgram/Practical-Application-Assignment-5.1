# Practical Application Assignment 5.1
The practical application I have used to study the dataset helps develop insights into the following question “Will a customer accept the coupon?”. I have developed this notebook for 2 coupon types & the various acceptance numbers help develop insights into the customer & coupon acceptance rates. 
#
# Brief Description of the Dataset
The data used for the data analysis assignment comes from the UCI Machine Learning repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios, including the destination, current time, weather, passenger, etc., and then asks people whether they will accept the coupon if they are the driver. Answers given that the users will drive there “right away” or “later before the coupon expires” are labeled as “Y = 1”, and answers “no, I do not want the coupon” are labeled as “Y = 0”. There are five different types of coupons—less expensive restaurants (under $20), coffee houses, carry out and take away, bars, and more expensive restaurants ($20–$50).
